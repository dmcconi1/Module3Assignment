WARNING: some of the web services used for this application have broken entries particularly in terms of Customer IDs. 
Please try a different CustomerID if your chosen one does not respond. 

This application is designed to allow the user two primary ways to navigate throught the use of this web service database-driven application. 
By going to the customer list, a user can simply click the buttons in the created tables to end up in the section to update order info
and see the reflected changes after acknowledging that the update operation was successful.


Users may also click the Retrieve Order button on the Customer List and then type in the Customer ID into the field in the Current Orders
section. From there the user may click the Retrieve Customer's Current Orders button to see the table and the Update Order button for each 
entry. Once the updates are made the Update Order button is pressed, the user will acknowledge the operation was successful causing the
changes to show and reflect automatically as well.
